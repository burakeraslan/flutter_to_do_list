# flutter_to_do_list

This mobile application allows users to create a simple to-do list.
The app uses Firebase Cloud Firestore to store data, enabling real-time synchronization of to-do items across devices.

### Features:

- Add new to-do items.
- Mark completed items.
- Delete items as needed.

### Usage:
If you have items in your to-do list, they will be displayed on the screen as a list.
To add a new to-do item, type the item text in the "Add new item" text field at the bottom and press the "enter" key on your device's keyboard.
To mark an item as completed, simply tap on the item.
To delete an item, long-press on the item, and a confirmation dialog will appear. Press the "Delete" button to remove the item permanently or the "Close" button to cancel the operation.
